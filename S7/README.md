Experiment different model architecture for achieving test accuracy more than 99.4% using a model with less than 8k Parameters.

`Model_1`
#### Target:
Architecture to have 
    - Getting the skeleton right
    - Perform MaxPooling after the layer with 5 rececptive field
    - Including dropout of 10% in all the layers
    - Have fully convolutional layer instead of fully connected layer
    - LR scheduler

#### Results:
