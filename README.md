# Image Classifier

This repository contains the scripts to develop a image classifier in PyTorch.

# Usage

> ## `Utils.py`
> Plotting contains functions for primarily two process.
> ### Data preparation
> This python script provides the neccessary functions for preparing the dataset by doing the following operations
> - Builds a PyTorch Dataset using downloaded MNIST dataset 
> - DataLoader which includes data transformation
>
> ### Plotting
> It also provides function for plotting a batch of images and plotting the performance curves.
> ## `Model.ipynb`
> This script helps us create a PyTorch convolution model with following architecture and it has the functions for training and testing the script.
> 
> ## `S5.ipynb`
> This notebooks high level scripts to overall pipeline to build the Image classifier and provides visualizations too.
